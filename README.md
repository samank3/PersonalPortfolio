# What I Learned

I am currently on the beautiful journey of front-end web developing. Through creating my personal portfolio, I strengthened my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. New skills I picked up are working Bootstrap (which I am now quite familiar with), jQuery, Document Object Model (DOM), and Node.js. My personal portfolio is an ongoing journey, and I aspire to update it with all relevant aspects of my life - both academic and personal!
